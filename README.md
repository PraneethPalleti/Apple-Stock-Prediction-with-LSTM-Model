# Apple Stock Prediction with LSTM Model  

## Overview  
This project leverages a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model to predict Apple's stock prices using historical data. **Time series analysis**, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques were applied to improve accuracy.  

## Technologies Used  
- `Keras` – Deep learning framework  
- `LSTM` – Recurrent Neural Network for sequential data  
- `Time Series Analysis` – Feature engineering for stock price trends  
- `Model Evaluation` – RMSE & MAPE metrics  
- `Data Visualization` – Matplotlib & Seaborn for insights  

## Features  
- Data preprocessing & time series feature engineering  
- LSTM model implementation and training  
- Performance evaluation using RMSE & MAPE  
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted stock prices  

## Results  
- **15% Accuracy Improvement** over baseline models  
- Enhanced visualization techniques for stock trend insights  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
